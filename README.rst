pyMolDyn
########


pyMolDyn is a molecule viewer capable of computing molecular cavities. It is assumed that the analyzed molecule resides
in a cell shape corresponding to one of the seven bravais lattice systems.

Features
========

-   Interactive molecule viewer based on GR3
-   Computation of molecular cavities in all seven Bravais lattice systems
-   Creation of high resolution images appropriate for publications
-   Video creation from a set of input frames to analyse cavity changes in materials over time
-   Statistics including

    -   Surfaces, volumes and surface volume ratios of cavities and domains
    -   Radial distribution, bonds, bond (dihedral) angles

-   Filter for atoms and cavities
-   Batch mode for processing several input files at once
